# Hangman - Pygame

### Introduction

I made this game to refresh my Python skills and to learn Pygame!
I also implemented OOP principles, which I am still learning, but getting better at!

### Installation

1. Download the Python 3 installer if you don't have it already.
2. Install Pygame by running `pip3 install pygame` in the command line.
3. Download the source codes (including the `images` folder)
4. Run `python3 hangman.py` in the command line.

### Description

Hangman is a simple game where you have to guess a word by guessing letters.
If you guess a letter that is in the word, the letter will be revealed.
If you guess a letter that is not in the word, you lose a life.
You have 7 lives to guess the word.
If you guess the word before you lose all your lives, you win!
